# HUBRIS

A simple dependently typed lambda calculus. The goal of this is to show
a very simple tutorial implementation with as many of the complexities
abstracted away as possible.

## Building
This project requires `ghc` and `cabal`.

To install dependencies run `cabal install --only-dependencies`.
To get a working Hubris repl, run `cabal run`.

## Write Up
There is an associated write up that can be found at
`write-up/dt-simple.md`
